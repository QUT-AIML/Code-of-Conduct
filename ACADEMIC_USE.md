## Purpose

This repository is maintained by the **QUT AI & ML Society**, a student club at Queensland University of Technology (QUT).

The code and materials in this repository are shared to support learning, experimentation, and community engagement. This document outlines how the content may and may not be used, particularly in academic contexts.

## QUT Academic Integrity Expectations

QUT’s Manual of Policy and Procedures (MOPP) sets clear expectations around academic integrity. Students are required to act honestly and ethically in all assessed work and to ensure that submitted work demonstrates their own understanding and effort.

Under these expectations:

- Presenting another person’s work as your own is not permitted.
- Using existing code in assessments without appropriate authority may be considered plagiarism or collusion.
- Submitting work that undermines the purpose of an assessment may constitute academic misconduct.

This applies to all forms of work, including software code, algorithms, models, reports, and other technical artefacts.

This notice is intended to support students in complying with these principles.

## Permitted Uses

You are welcome to use this repository in the following ways:

- Reading and studying the code to understand concepts and techniques.
- Using the code as a reference while learning or practising independently.
- Experimenting with the code for personal or non-graded projects.
- Discussing or analysing the code in written or verbal work, provided it is clearly acknowledged and not submitted for academic credit.

These uses support learning without compromising academic integrity.

## Prohibited Uses

You must **not** use this repository in the following ways:

- Submitting this code, in whole or in part, as part of any academic assessment.
- Copying, adapting, or lightly modifying the code for assignments, labs, projects, or exams.
- Using this repository as a base, template, or starting point for graded coursework.
- Claiming this work, or derivatives of it, as your own in academic submissions.

This applies regardless of whether the repository is public or freely accessible.

## Why This Matters

QUT’s academic integrity framework is designed to ensure that assessment outcomes accurately reflect a student’s own learning and skills.

Breaches of academic integrity, including plagiarism and collusion, can result in serious consequences such as loss of marks, reassessment, or formal academic misconduct proceedings.

The QUT AI & ML Society does not wish to place students at risk by having its work misused in assessment contexts.

## Attribution and Acknowledgement

Attribution alone does **not** make it acceptable to submit this code or derivatives of it for academic assessment.

While proper acknowledgement is appropriate for discussion and analysis, it does not permit the use of this code in graded work unless explicit written permission has been obtained from both the relevant unit coordinator and the repository maintainers.

---

## If You Are Unsure

If you are uncertain whether your intended use is acceptable, please assume it is **not** and seek clarification before proceeding.

It is always better to ask than to risk breaching academic integrity requirements.
